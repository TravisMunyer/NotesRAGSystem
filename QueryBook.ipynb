      "In research, it is often the case that we develop a performant ML algorithm and say these are the data we need for it. Though, it is more practical to work with what we have and develop an ML algo from that.\n",

AI is also discussed in terms of its role in creating more \"fun\" and human-like experiences, such as aiming in a game.\n",
